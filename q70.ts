//Understanding let in Loops: Write a function that uses a loop with the let keyword to print numbers from 1 to 5. Explain how the let keyword affects the visibility of the loop variable.

// This function prints numbers from 1 to 5 using a loop

function printNumberWithLet() {
    for (let i =1; i <= 5; i++){          // Uses `let` for loop variable `i`
        console.log(i);                    // Logs numbers 1 through 5
    }
}                                   // `i` is not accessible here, outside the loop, because it's defined with `let`
 printNumberWithLet ();

// This shows that `let` limits `i` to the loop, preventing errors from using `i` where it's not intended.
